I was working as a project manager and few years as a manager for a mobile app. I enjoyed working closely with devs througout this whole experience and it was there that I first discovered RUBY.
Now, here I am, freshly graduated from the web dev coding bootcamp @Le Wagon from batch #731 ðŸ’ª
and eager to keep exploring this brave new coding world ðŸ”­ ðŸ¤©
